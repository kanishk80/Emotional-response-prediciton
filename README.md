This project involves analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) data using various machine learning techniques to predict health outcomes. The dataset contains HRV metrics such as mean NN interval and SDNN, among others. The analysis workflow includes data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation. Technologies used include Python for core programming, Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and numerical computations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks like preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive environment for running and documenting the analysis process, aiming to derive insights and enhance predictive modeling in health analytics.
